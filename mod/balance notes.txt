Chain Reaction is very powerful but in a fun way?

Salt could use with a downside like +10% to blind. Currently it is the only alchemical that is an insta-use
Terra could be buffed.

Chain Reaction + Brimstone could be fine tuned

Glass could maybe be 2 or 3, or swapped with Bismuth?
Maybe Bismuth could add polychrome to jokers instead?

Uranium + seals is amazing

Antimony doesnt work on end-of-round jokers (e.g. To the moon)

Alch seal ideas:
- Create alch card when drawn to hand
- Draw to hand when playing an alch card

Blueprint + chain reaction bugged
